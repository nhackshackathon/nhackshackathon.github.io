As the first, we’ve decided to set an example for young hackers around the state. We had over 100 attendees and mentors and were featured on TV. 2 years ago, we added Microsoft, Soylent, Nexcess, and about 20 other companies as sponsors, and surpassed 175 registrants. Last year, as we approached unforeseen time periods, we shifted to an online hackathon and reached over 20 countries, surpassing over 300 registrants for a virtual hackathon. This year, NHacks is going to be the biggest and best it has ever been.">
